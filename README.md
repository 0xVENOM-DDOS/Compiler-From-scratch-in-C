## 🚀 Project Overview

**C-Compiler-From-Scratch** is a ground-up implementation of a C compiler designed to demystify the process of compiling C code. This project provides a robust, extensible, and educational codebase that can parse, analyze, and compile a significant subset of the C programming language—including pointers, structures, unions, arrays, control flow, and more.

Our compiler features a custom macro preprocessor, supports header file inclusion, and can interface with the GCC standard library, enabling the compilation of real-world C programs.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Full Lexical Analysis:** Converts C source code into tokens for easier parsing.
- **Recursive Descent Parser:** Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the logical structure of C code.
- **Macro Preprocessor:** Handles `#include` and `#define` directives.
- **AST-Based Compilation:** Supports complex C constructs—pointers, structs, unions, arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, and switches.
- **GCC Standard Library Integration:** Enables calls to standard C functions.
- **No Frameworks:** 100% handcrafted for transparency and learning.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extensible for new features or language constructs.

- **Lexer:** Tokenizes input C source code.
- **Parser:** Builds the AST from tokens.
- **Preprocessor:** Handles macros and file inclusions.
- **Codegen:** Generates target code (assembly or intermediate).
- **AST:** Represents program structure for analysis and transformation.
